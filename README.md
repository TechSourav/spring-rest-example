# spring-rest-example

This is a simple example on how to create and consume a REST service in a Java Spring environment.
Import this as a Maven project, run in a Servlet Container like Tomcat(TM) or an Application Server
of your choice.

When opening the starting page:
http://localhost:9090/spring-rest-example/

...you will be presented with a response from a dummy rest service. To run the other services go to the
TestSpringRestExample.java right-click with mouse button and run it as a java application. Just be sure
that the application is already running in your Tomcat before doing this last step.
